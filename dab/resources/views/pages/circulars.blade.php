            <p> ELiquidity plays an important role in the economy and changes in the level of liquidity should be consistent with the economic growth and the needs for money in the economy. Considering the banking sector expansion and its role in creating money, the economic conditions of the country, DAB has set reserve money as the primary and currency in circulation as the secondary index of liquidity. To manage the reserve money growth, DAB utilizes two monetary tools; the foreign exchange auction and the open market operation (sale of capital notes) as the primary monetary policy instruments.<br><br>
              The second monetary policy instrument used by Da Afghanistan Bank is the capital notes that are sold to commercial bank on a weekly basis. In order to expand the use of this instrument, which could be an important alternative for foreign exchange auction, Da Afghanistan Bank introduced new capital notes of 364 day in addition to the existing capital notes of 28 day and 182 day, this increases investment opportunity in this instrument. Da Afghanistan Bank intends to develop the secondary market of CNs to increase the role of this instrument in managing the liquidity.
